## About
- The Ansible Network Backup Validated Content provides a comprehensive solution for managing network backups and restores across supported network platforms. This validated content offers two key functionalities: `backup` and `restore`, each designed to be platform-agnostic and user-friendly.

- The `backup` role allows users to create, compare, and tag backups, supporting both local and remote data stores. This ensures that network configurations are regularly and securely backed up, providing a reliable method to safeguard network infrastructure.

- The `restore` role enables users to fetch backups from local or remote data stores and perform configuration restores. This functionality ensures that network configurations can be swiftly and accurately restored when needed, minimizing downtime and maintaining network stability.

- The Network Backup Content is ideal for system administrators and IT professionals who need to manage and maintain network infrastructure, automate the backup and restore process, and ensure data is regularly and securely backed up and available for restoration as required.

## Requirements
- [Requires Ansible](https://github.com/redhat-cop/network.backup/blob/main/meta/runtime.yml)
- [Requires Content Collections](https://github.com/redhat-cop/network.backup/blob/main/galaxy.yml#L5https://forum.ansible.com/c/news/5/none)
- [Testing Requirements](https://github.com/redhat-cop/network.backup/blob/main/test-requirements.txt)
- Users also need to include platform collections as per their requirements. The supported platform collections are:
  - [arista.eos](https://github.com/ansible-collections/arista.eos) >= v9.0.0
  - [cisco.ios](https://github.com/ansible-collections/cisco.ios) >= v8.0.0
  - [cisco.iosxr](https://github.com/ansible-collections/cisco.iosxr) >= v9.0.0
  - [cisco.nxos](https://github.com/ansible-collections/cisco.nxos) >= v8.0.0
  - [junipernetworks.junos](https://github.com/ansible-collections/junipernetworks.junos) >= v8.0.0


## Installation
To consume this Validated Content from Automation Hub, the following needs to be added to ansible.cfg:
```
[galaxy]
server_list = automation_hub

[galaxy_server.automation_hub]
url=https://console.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/content/validated/
auth_url=https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token
token=<SuperSecretToken>
```

Utilize the current Token, and if the token has expired, obtain the necessary
token from the [Automation Hub Web UI](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/token).

With this configured, simply run the following commands:

```
ansible-galaxy collection install network.backup
```

## Use Cases

**Full Backup**:
- Allows users to retrieve the running network configuration from the device and save it to a local or remote data store.
- Users can also upload backup files to GitHub, with the option to add tags for better organization.

**Differential Backup**:
- Enables users to back up the network configuration only if there have been changes since the last backup.
- Users can perform a differential backup and save the updated files either to a local data store or a GitHub repository, with the option to add tags for better organization.

**Restore Configuration**:
- Allows users to restore a previously backed-up configuration.
- Users can compare the running configuration with the backup to identify differences and restore the configuration only if differences are found.

## Testing

The project uses tox to run `ansible-lint` and `ansible-test sanity`.
Assuming this repository is checked out in the proper structure,
e.g. `collections_root/ansible_collections/network/backup`, run:

```shell
  tox -e ansible-lint
  tox -e py39-sanity
```

To run integration tests, ensure that your inventory has a `network_backup` group.
Depending on what test target you are running, comment out the host(s).

```shell
[network_hosts]
ios
junos

[ios:vars]
< enter inventory details for this group >

[junos:vars]
< enter inventory details for this group >
```

```shell
  ansible-test network-integration -i /path/to/inventory --python 3.9 [target]
```
